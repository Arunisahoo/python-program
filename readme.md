what is python ?

-python is simple ,easy & portable.
-python is free and open sources.
-python is high level,interpreted language.
-python was devloped by Guido van Rosum.

- Python is interpreted language means when we write python code its executed the code line by line thats when we called python is 
 interpreted language.
 - print is function to give output statement in python. simply we can tell "print" is output function.

 character set of python language :-
 1.letter-> A-Z , a-z
 2.Digits-> 0-9
 3.Special character-> -,+,/,* etc...
 4.Whitespaces-> Blankspaces, Tab ,newline


What is variable in python:- a variable is a name given to a memory location in a program or else we can simply say variable is a container to store some data.

example-
name="Aruni"
age= 25
salary= 23000.56

variable names - name, age, salary
variable values - "Aruni", 25, 23000.56

Rules for Identifires:-
1. identifires - names of the variable
2. identifires can be combination of uppercase and lowercase letter, digits or an underscore(_).ex. - -myVariable, variable_1
3. an identifires can not starts with digits. so while variable1 is valid but 1variable is not valid.
4. we cannot use special character or symbols  like !,#,@,%etc...
5. identifires can be of any length.
6. variables name should be small and meaningful like - when we give our age in that case we take the variable as "myAge".
myAge -> camel case letter


- 'type' is a operator to show the data types name in our variables like which datatypes we use in our variables.




Data Types:-

-mainly data types of 5 types in python.
-These data types are unmutable or build-in data types.
1. Integer - +ve value, 0, -ve value
2. String - "hello", "Aruni" etc...
3. Float - 3.91, 4.00, 9.1 etc..
4. Boolean - True, False
5. None - not assign


Comments in python :-

-when we write some code but we dont want to execute it then we give the comment line to that place so that line of code will not executed.
-comments are of 2 types -
1. Single line comment -
  when we give the single line comments in python we did it on "3".
  ex.
  # single line comment
  # this is a comment
2. Multi line comment -
  when we give the multiline comment in python we did it through """-""".
  ex.
  """
   multi line
   comments
  """ 


  Types of Operator :-
  -simply we can say operator is a symbol that performs a certain operation between operands.
  ex. a + b
      a,b -> operands
      + -> operator
  -there are 4 types of operator are present in python
  1. arithmetic operator. - (+,-,/,%,*)
  2. Relational operator. - (==,!=,>,<,>+,<=)
  3. assignment operator - (=,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=)
  4. logical operator  (and, or, not)




  Input in python :-

  -Input() statements is used to accept values(use keyword) from users.


  Task to do practice -
  1. write a program to input 2 numbers & print their sum
  2. write a program to input side of a square & print its area.
  3. write a program to input 2 floating point numbers & print their average.
  4. write a program to input 2 int numbers a & b, print True if a is greater then or equal to, if not print false.    


Strings :-

-String is datatype that stores a sequence of characters.

str1 = "this is a good day"
str2 = 'This is beautiful day'
str3 = """this is a bad day"""


-all these strings are real string because in python, it supports all of these syntax like - "",'',""" """

- \n (new line) - when we want to break our line into a new line then we can give the new line symbol in that place so the line get breaked automatically
basic operation of strings:-
1. concatenation->
"hello"+"world"
2. length of strings->
len(str)

Indexing of string ->

-webbocket -> 012345678(indexing)
-indexing start from '0'.

Slicing of string ->

- Accessing parts of a string.
- ending index is not counting.
- syntax - str[starting_index : ending_index]

str = "webbocket"
str[0:3] - web
str[3:] - bocket
str[:3] - web



Function of string ->

ex-
str = "i am a coder."
1. str.endswith("er.") - returns true if string ends with substring
2. str.capitalize() - return 1st char is capital
3. str.replace(old,new) - replace all occurance of old with new
4. str.find(word) - returns 1st index of 1st occurrence
5. str.count("am") - counts the occurrence of substring in string

Homework :-
1. write a program to input users first name & print its length.
2. write a program to find the occerrence of '$' in a string.

conditional statement:-
- used to handle the condition in your program.
- syntax (if-elif-else)
- elif means else-if

if(condition):
 statement1
elif(condition):
 statement2
else:
 statement(default)

 Homework :-
 1. write a program to check if a number entered by the user if odd or even.
 2. write a program to find the greatest of 3 numbers entered by the user
 3. write a program to check if a number is a multiple of 7 or not.



 List in python:-

 - List is a built-in data type that stores set of values.
 - it can store element of different types like integer, float & string etc..
 - in list we can make indexing.
 - in list we can find length of the list also.
 - in list we can also do the slicing activity.

 ex-
 marks = [87, 45, 67, 45] - array and list
 student = ["hitesh", 85, "bbsr" ] - list




 List Slicing :-

 - it similar to string slicing.
 - syntax :- list_name[starting_idx : ending_idx]
 _ ending index is not included.

 marks = [23,25,67,78,98]
 marks[1:4] -> [25,67,78]
 marks[:3] -> [23,25,67]
 marks[2:] -> [67,78,98]


 List Method:-

 list = [9,4,7,8,1]
 list.append(6) - adds one element at the end of the list - [9,4,7,8,1,6]
 list.sort() - sort the elements in assending order - [1,4,7,8,9]
 list.sort(reverse=True)  sorts the elements in decending order - [9,8,7,4,1]
 list.reverse() - reversing the list - [1,8,7,4,9]
 list.insert(idx,el) - insert the element at index
 list.remove(1) - remove the first occurrance of element - [9,7,8,1]
 list.pop(idx) - remove elements at index




 git :- 
 - git is an open source repository system where we can save, manipulate, colaborate our code with any   one else.
 - in our software era, everyone can use git system for their software development.
 - we also called git is a version control system.
 - git provides some tools to use their functionality and features ex - github, gitlab etc..
